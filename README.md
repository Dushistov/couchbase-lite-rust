# couchbase-lite-rust [![Build Status](https://github.com/Dushistov/couchbase-lite-rust/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Dushistov/couchbase-lite-rust/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)

Rust wrapper for couchbase-lite-core lightweight, embedded, syncable NoSQL database engine.

Quote from [couchbase-lite-core](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-core)

> **Couchbase Lite Core** (aka **LiteCore**) is the next-generation core storage and query engine for [Couchbase Lite][CBL]. It provides a cross-platform implementation of the database CRUD and query features, document versioning, and replication/sync.
> All platform implementations of Couchbase Lite (from 2.0 onward) are built atop this core, adding higher-level language & platform bindings. But LiteCore may find other uses too, perhaps for applications that want a fast minimalist data store with map/reduce indexing and queries, but don't need the higher-level features of Couchbase Lite.

## Optional features

You can use bundled version of couchbase-lite-core or set path
